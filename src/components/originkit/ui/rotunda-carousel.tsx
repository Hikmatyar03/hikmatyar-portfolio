/**
 * ROTUNDA CAROUSEL — a ring of pictures, seen from INSIDE it, for Framer.
 *
 * TypeBandCarousel is the outside of a cylinder. This is the inside: the camera
 * stands on the ring's axis and the images are hung on the wall around it, so
 * turning the ring sweeps them past you rather than spinning a drum in front of
 * you. Everything below follows from that one difference.
 *
 * THE CAMERA IS STRICTLY INSIDE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE COMPLEXITY BUDGET.
 * A ray leaving a point inside a convex cylinder crosses the wall exactly once.
 * Algebraically: with the camera at (0, 0, d) and the wall at r = 1, the
 * quadratic in t has constant term d*d - 1, which is NEGATIVE for every d < 1,
 * so its two roots straddle zero and precisely one is forward. Nothing on the
 * wall can occlude anything else on the wall. So there is no depth buffer, no
 * back-to-front sort, and no two-pass face cull — the sibling's entire winding
 * argument evaporates. Distance is clamped to 0.9 of the radius to keep that
 * true, and the pitch rotates the camera ABOUT its own position rather than
 * swinging it around the origin, or a large Tilt would lift the eye out through
 * the top rim and occlusion would come back.
 *
 * It also means a gap between two panels shows the BACKGROUND, never the far
 * wall: the near gap and the hit point are the same point. That is what makes
 * "curved panels with gaps" read as a rotunda instead of as a see-through cage.
 *
 * ONE TEXTURE PER IMAGE, NOT AN ATLAS. The sibling needs an atlas because it
 * REPEAT-wraps one strip around the ring, which is where its power-of-two
 * padding inflates Gap. Here each panel is drawn once, so per-image textures
 * cost 8-24 draw calls (nothing) and skip both the packing and the resolution
 * loss of cropping into a cell. Each picture is resampled into a power-of-two
 * canvas before upload — full bleed, so normalized UVs address exactly the same
 * content and only the texel density changes — which buys mipmaps and
 * anisotropy on WebGL1 for the panels near the silhouette, where a raw LINEAR
 * sample smears into a streak.
 *
 * DRAG IS THE INVERSE PROJECTION, NOT A SCRUB RATE. "One component width = half
 * a turn" is fine for a band you watch from outside; from inside, the wall under
 * the pointer would slide out from under it, because screen x maps to ring angle
 * through an arctangent, not a scale. On pointerdown the ray is un-pitched,
 * intersected with the cylinder and the hit angle recorded; every move re-solves
 * it and sets yaw so that same wall point stays pinned to the pointer.
 *
 * THE RING IS DERIVED FROM THE PANELS, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. Width, Height
 * and Gap are one unit, and the radius is whatever makes n panels plus n gaps
 * close the circle: R = n * (Width + Gap) / 2pi. So Width : Height IS the
 * picture aspect a designer types (800 x 600 is 4:3 and crops like it), and
 * Width : Gap is how much of the wall is picture. Nothing can disagree, because
 * there is no second dial claiming the same dimension.
 *
 * What still follows the item count is ANGULAR size, and that is not a dial
 * anyone can fix: standing at the centre of a ring, a panel subtends exactly
 * 2pi * Width / (n * (Width + Gap)), so twice as many pictures is half the
 * angle each. Distance is the framing dial against it. Very few items therefore
 * make very wide panels; at three, one panel is 98 degrees across and cannot
 * fit a 50-degree lens at any Distance. Raise Gap or lower Width. That is the
 * geometry, not a bug to dial around.
 *
 * Rule 6 recipe: ONE GL context built in useEffect([]); every live input read
 * from a ref inside a raw rAF loop (raw rAF ticks on the Framer canvas, unlike
 * IntersectionObserver / framer-motion appear props). Never calls
 * loseContext() — getContext hands back the same force-lost context on the next
 * StrictMode mount and renders black.
 *
 * TWO POINTER TERMS, NOT ONE (rule M). Damping is how a flick decays — input
 * physics. Hover is how much resting the pointer on the wall slows its own
 * drift, which is what lets you actually look at a picture. Different things.
